## Conclusion

The concepts in the COSMOS repository currently lack validation at even the most basic level (specification). A systematic validation program following this framework would require:

- **Time:** 5-10 years minimum
- **Resources:** $10M-$100M+ depending on scope
- **Team:** Interdisciplinary experts
- **Facilities:** Laboratory, computational resources
- **Commitment:** Long-term sustained effort

**Recommendation:** Begin with Phase 1 (Specification) for the most promising concepts before investing in later phases.
