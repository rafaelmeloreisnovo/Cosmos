## Conclusion

The COSMOS repository contains multiple discovery claims spanning mathematics, cosmology, energy physics, and computer science. Most claims are at early conceptual stages (TRL 1-2) and require substantial development and validation. The highest-potential discoveries (galaxy pattern analysis, energy conversion) merit focused development and validation efforts. Interdisciplinary and philosophical frameworks provide interesting conceptual contributions but are distinct from scientifically validatable discoveries.

**Overall Discovery Maturity: Early Stage**
**Path Forward: Specification → Implementation → Validation → Publication**
