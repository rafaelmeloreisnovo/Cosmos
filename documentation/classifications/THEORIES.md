## Conclusion

The theoretical frameworks in the COSMOS repository are at very early conceptual stages (average rating: 1.9/10). To develop into scientific theories, they require:

1. **Mathematical formalization** (highest priority)
2. **Mechanism specification** (essential)
3. **Empirical testing** (critical)
4. **Peer review** (necessary for acceptance)

Currently, these frameworks represent interesting ideas and philosophical perspectives that require substantial development to achieve scientific theory status. The most promising path forward is to select one framework (recommend ATOMIC_EX_LIGHT or Modified Fibonacci) and focus on rigorous development rather than attempting to advance all simultaneously.
