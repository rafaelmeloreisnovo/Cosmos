## International Considerations

### Key Jurisdictions

1. **United States (USPTO)**
   - Large market
   - Software/business method patents possible but restricted
   - First-to-file system

2. **European Union (EPO)**
   - Software "as such" not patentable
   - Must show technical effect
   - More restrictive than US

3. **Brazil (INPI)**
   - Home jurisdiction for repository creator
   - Important for enforcement
   - Portuguese language advantage

4. **China (CNIPA)**
   - Large market
   - Important for manufacturing
   - Local enforcement considerations

### PCT Strategy

File PCT application to preserve options for 30+ months before committing to expensive national phase filings.

---

## Conclusion

The COSMOS repository contains several concepts with patent potential, ranging from 2/10 to 6/10. The Galaxy Pattern Recognition System shows the highest near-term patent potential, while ATOMIC_EX_LIGHT has the highest potential impact but requires substantial development.

**Key Recommendation:** Focus development resources on the most patentable and market-viable innovations (Galaxy Pattern Recognition, ZIPRAF format) while filing defensive publications on other concepts to prevent competitor patents.

**Estimated Investment for Patent Portfolio:** $50,000 - $150,000 over 3 years for selective filing strategy.

**Alternative Recommendation:** Consider open-source strategy with selective trade secret protection for core algorithms, which may provide better ROI for academic/scientific innovations.
