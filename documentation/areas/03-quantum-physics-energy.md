## 13. Conclusion

The quantum physics and energy concepts in the COSMOS repository, particularly the ATOMIC_EX_LIGHT project, represent ambitious early-stage ideas addressing critical global challenges. While grounded in established physical principles (radioactive energy conversion, radioluminescence), the specific mechanisms and feasibility remain unspecified.

The concept of high-efficiency conversion of radioactive waste to usable light would be revolutionary if realized, addressing both energy needs and nuclear waste management. However, substantial technical development, theoretical modeling, and experimental validation are required to assess true feasibility.

**Current Status:** TRL 1-2 (Conceptual stage)
**Potential Impact:** Very High (if validated)
**Recommendation:** Priority development of technical specification and theoretical modeling
