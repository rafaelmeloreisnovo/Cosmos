## 6. Repository IP Strategy Assessment

### 6.1 Current Status
- Public repository (GitHub)
- Content publicly accessible
- No patent applications filed (apparent)
- Copyright claimed

### 6.2 Recommendations

**For Maximum Protection:**
1. **File provisional patents** for novel inventions
2. **Maintain detailed records** of invention dates
3. **Use appropriate licenses** (consider MIT, Apache for code)
4. **Document trade secrets** separately from public repo
5. **Register copyright** (optional but provides benefits)

### 6.3 "Spiritual Authorship" Concept

**Legal Status:**
- Not recognized in IP law
- Authorship requires human creation (in most jurisdictions)
- AI-generated content: Unclear status, evolving law

- Automatic copyright in member countries (177+ countries)
- No registration required
- National treatment principle

### 7.2 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)

- Delays national filing decisions

### 7.3 Madrid System (Trademarks)

- Single application for multiple countries

---

## 8. Enforcement

### 8.1 Copyright Infringement
- Cease and desist letters
- DMCA takedown notices (for online)
- Litigation (expensive, time-consuming)

### 8.2 Patent Infringement
- Patent holder must actively enforce
- Litigation costs: $1M-$5M+ (US)
- Alternative: Licensing agreements

## 9. Risk Assessment

### 9.1 Risks of Public Disclosure
- ❌ Patent rights may be lost (prior art)
